## Why Generate YouTube Timestamp Links?
Manually creating timestamps can be confusing. YouTube requires a specific format (`?t=60` or `&t=1m30s`), and getting it wrong means the link won‚Äôt jump to the right moment. With a **YouTube Timestamp Link Generator**, you can make accurate links in seconds.

## Manual Method
Here‚Äôs the manual way to do it:
1. Pause the YouTube video at the exact moment you want.  
2. Right-click and choose **‚ÄúCopy video URL at current time.‚Äù**  
3. Share the copied link.  

**Downside:** This only works for one timestamp at a time, and you don‚Äôt get options for formatting or multiple timestamps.
